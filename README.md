LoL Champions is based off the popular MOBA game, League of Legends. This website is used to help a beginner player get a better understanding of the game and its champions.

There are several different features in this website, all which were retrieved using the offical Riot Games API:
 - It shows which champions are available for free that week.
 - Show the user which champions are being played the most in a chosen rank. There are 9 different ranks, the user simply clicks       on one and the data is retrieved.
 - The website holds data on all of the 144 champions. Either click on a slider or use the search bar to find a specific champion and a page will appear giving information on the champions stats, ability icons and descriptions, and all the available skins.
